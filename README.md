# Portfolio Optimization methods
Study of various approaches to portfolio optimization. The code is stored in two separate scripts: **PortfolioOptimizerSPDR.py** and **TasksSPDR.py**. First file contains the `PortfolioOptimizer` superclass with corresponding subclasses of specific portfolios, while the second file contains a script used to run and evaluate the strategies.

The `PortfolioOptimizer` class was constructed in an object oriented manner with the use of inheritance. The motivation for such a solution was supported by code reproducibility and efficiency. More details can be found in the aforementioned scripts.

Data utilized in the study is contained in the **SecuritiesData.xlsx** spreadsheet. The result assessment is discussed in **PortfolioOptimizationReport.pdf** file.
